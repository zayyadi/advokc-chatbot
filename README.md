*   **Knowledge Base:** Utilizes Nigerian civic legal frameworks, campaign promises, and ADVOKC's activity data.
*   **Promise Tracking:** Features a module to monitor the status of political promises.
*   **Tech Stack:** FastAPI (backend), React/Next.js (frontend), ChromaDB (vector store), PostgreSQL (database).
